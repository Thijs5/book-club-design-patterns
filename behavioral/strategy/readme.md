# Fantasy Medieval Clicking Simulator

Requirements to implement:
- Make our `Hero` compatible with all the objects in the weapons folder.
- Implement the `DragonHunterSpear` so it doubles the damage on characters of type `dragon`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
