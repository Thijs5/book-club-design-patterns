# Memento

In the Kata folder, you can find the base to get started. The solution is found in the solution folder.

## Intro

We're a game-map company using a blazor app. sadly, we forgot an undo function ... doh. So let's apply the memento pattern to fix this!.

Do note, due to blazor and the use of a foreach loop inside the svg to show our map, the UI isn't updated correctly. however, the code should work in the solution folder if you set a breakpoint.
