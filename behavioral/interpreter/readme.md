# Interpreter

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.0.4.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Exercise
We're roleplaying as the Windows calculator developing team. When writing tests we discovered our calculator doesn't take in account the order of calculation.

The goal of the exercise is to refactor the `calculator`-class using the interpreter pattern so an expression, e.g. `50 - 5 * 5` calculates to `25` and not `225`. There are tests included for this class. To run the tests, run `ng test`.
